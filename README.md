Initial representation of the repo's structure:

1. Firstly, you need to clone this repository near your datasets' folder. We are not going to store datasets in the repository, but we suppose that the needed data is downloaded to "datasets/dataset_name".

2. Each dataset has its own folder for testing inside "experiments/dataset_name" because we want to run tests independendently.

3. You are able to upload your model into "models/your_model_name" for easier support, but it's not mandatory.


Workflow:

Once the new folder "experiments/dataset_name" appeared you need to update the repository, run the code for your model and add results to a table.
